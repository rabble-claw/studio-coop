## 1. Mindbody

**The incumbent. Most expensive. Biggest marketplace.**

### Pricing
- Starter → Accelerate → Ultimate tiers, from $110 AUD/mo per location
- "Let's Talk" for actual pricing (no transparent pricing)
- Branded app is an add-on, not included
- AI chatbot (Messenger[ai]) is an add-on

### Strengths
- **Massive consumer marketplace**: 3M+ active users, 720M bookings/year
- Established brand trust — "over 40,000 businesses"
- Full-stack: payments, scheduling, marketing, reporting, staff management
- Claims 45% revenue growth in 6 months
- Data migration support included
- Unlimited users on all plans

### Weaknesses
- **No transparent pricing** — every plan requires "Let's Talk"
- **No free trial** — demo only
- **No social/community features at all** — purely transactional
- Expensive — studios complain about cost
- Buggy (per Rabble's experience)
- No visible community features, video sharing, or social integration
- Features page returned 404 — site quality issues

### Social Gap: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (massive)
Zero community features. Members book, pay, leave. No way to share content, connect with other members, or build community through the platform. The "community" happens entirely outside Mindbody (WhatsApp groups, Facebook, Instagram).

---

## 2. Vagaro

**Best value. Most transparent. Consumer-friendly.**

### Pricing
- $45 AUD/mo for 1 calendar (single person)
- Add-ons: Live Stream ($15/mo), Branded App ($280/mo), MySite ($30/mo), Text Marketing ($15/mo)
- No contract, cancel anytime, no setup fees
- Payments starting at 1.9%

### Strengths
- **Most transparent pricing** — clear on the website
- **Free trial available**
- Cheapest base price
- Consumer marketplace with daily deals
- Live streaming for virtual classes ($15/mo add-on)
- Online shopping cart for products
- QuickBooks/Xero integration
- Free 1,000 email marketing messages/month
- Data Lake integration (Power BI, Salesforce, etc.)
- 17 years in business, 250K professionals

### Weaknesses
- Features page 404'd (AU locale issues)
- Branded app expensive ($280/mo)
- Add-ons stack up quickly
- Less fitness-focused — heavily salon/spa oriented
- Consumer marketplace skews beauty/wellness, not fitness

### Social Gap: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (big)
Live streaming is the closest thing to social, but it's one-way broadcast. No member-to-member connection, no video sharing, no community features.

---

## 3. Glofox (ABC Glofox)

**Best for pure fitness. Member engagement focus.**

### Pricing
- Custom/quote-based only
- Multi-step form: business type → locations → details → pricing
- No pricing shown on site

### Strengths
- **Most fitness-focused** of the bunch
- Claims 44% booking boost
- Strong member engagement pitch: push notifications, automated comms
- Staff app included
- Good reporting and analytics
- "Set and forget" automation
- Lead nurture and pipeline management
- Part of ABC Fitness Solutions (enterprise backing)

### Weaknesses
- **Zero pricing transparency**
- No marketplace (doesn't help studios acquire new members)
- No social features
- Heavy enterprise sales process

### Social Gap: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (big)
Engagement = automated messages. No real community. Push notifications ≠ social connection.

## 4. Mariana Tek

**Premium boutique play. Best UX story.**

### Pricing
- 3 tiers: Core → Core + Growth → Full Growth Bundle
- No prices shown — "Book a demo"
- Uses Stripe for payments (standard rates, no markup)

### Strengths
- **Best brand/UX story** — "celebrate milestones", "digital confetti on birthdays"
- Custom-branded iOS/Android apps on all plans
- Gamification features (challenges, milestones, goals)
- White-glove onboarding (5-8 weeks)
- 95% CSAT on support
- Multi-location management
- 70% of clients migrated from other platforms
- Tags and notes for personalized member experiences
- CRM and marketing automation

### Weaknesses
- No pricing transparency
- No marketplace
- Boutique-only (not for general gyms)
- Expensive (enterprise feel)
- No community/social features beyond gamification

### Social Gap: ⭐⭐⭐ (moderate)
Closest to social with gamification, milestones, challenges, and birthday celebrations. But it's studio→member communication, not member→member community. No video sharing, no group chats, no content creation.

## 5. WellnessLiving

**Best Mindbody alternative. Most aggressive pricing.**

### Pricing
- Starter: $69/mo (1 staff)
- Business: $199/mo (currently 80% off → $39/mo for 2 months)
- BusinessPro: $349/mo (currently $69/mo for 2 months)
- Enterprise: Custom

### Strengths
- **Most feature-rich for the price**
- AI features: "Isaac" churn predictor, "CAASI" AI front desk
- Book-a-Spot™ (pick your spot in class)
- Branded client app (Achieve™) + staff app (Elevate™)
- Explorer™ marketplace listing
- FitBUILDER
- Rewards/loyalty program built-in
- QuickBooks, Zapier, door access integrations
- Reserve with Google integration

### Weaknesses
- Explorer marketplace much smaller than Mindbody
- Aggressive sales/marketing (countdown timers, urgency)
- Lower tier limits to 1 staff member
- Comparison page with Mindbody returned 404

### Social Gap: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (big)
Rewards and loyalty are engagement tools, not community tools. Message Center exists but it's studio→member. No member-to-member interaction.

## The Opportunity

### What NONE of them do:
1. **Member-to-member social connection** — sharing dance videos, workout clips, achievements
2. **Private community spaces** — replacing WhatsApp/Facebook groups within the platform
3. **Content creation/sharing** — members posting videos of their progress
4. **Social feeds** — seeing what your gym community is doing
5. **Direct messaging between members**
6. **Group chats/discussions**
7. **Event/class discussion threads**

### The current fragmented member journey:
- **Book class** → Mindbody/Vagaro/etc.
- **Chat with classmates** → WhatsApp/Signal/Telegram group
- **Share videos** → Private Instagram
- **Get updates** → Email list + Facebook group
- **Community** → Scattered across 4-5 apps

### A unified platform could:
- Increase retention by deepening social connections (Rabble's thesis)
- Reduce studio admin overhead (one platform, not five)
- Create network effects (members invite members)
- Enable content-driven marketing (member UGC as social proof)
- Make switching costs higher (community is sticky)

### Pricing sweet spot:
- $69-149/mo (undercut Mindbody significantly)
- Include social/community in base tier (differentiator)
- Branded app included (not a $280 add-on)

### Key competitors to beat on:
- Mindbody: price + social + UX
- Vagaro: social features + fitness focus (they're salon-heavy)
- Mariana Tek: price (they're premium) + real community vs. gamification
- WellnessLiving: social + UX quality

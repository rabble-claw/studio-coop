Dear DotCoop Verification Team,

Thank you for your email regarding the verification of studio.coop.

Studio Co-operative Limited is a multi-stakeholder cooperative currently in the process of formal registration as a Co-operative Society under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014, through Co-operatives UK's Hive programme.

As we are in the process of incorporating, we are requesting provisional verification as outlined in your email. Please find the following documentation:

**1. Cooperative Governance Page (URL)**
https://studio.coop/cooperative.html
This page outlines our cooperative structure, ICA principles, membership classes, and governance model.

**2. Draft Rules (Bylaws)**
https://github.com/rabble-claw/studio-coop/blob/main/docs/cooperative/draft-rules.md
Our draft rules are based on the Co-operatives UK multi-stakeholder cooperative society model, covering objects, membership, democratic governance, and asset lock provisions.

**3. Registration Status**
We are applying to register through Co-operatives UK's Hive programme, which will result in FCA registration as a Co-operative Society. We expect registration to be completed within the next 2-3 months.

We would appreciate provisional verification while our formal registration is processed. We are happy to provide any additional documentation you may require.

Kind regards,

Studio Co-operative Limited

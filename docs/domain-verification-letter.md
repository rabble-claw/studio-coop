*Letter of Intent for Cooperative Formation*

---

**To:** DotCooperation LLC / Domain Registrar Verification Team

**From:** studio.coop Founding Team

**Date:** February 2026

**Re:** Registration of studio.coop — Cooperative Verification

---

## Purpose

We are writing to request registration of the domain **studio.coop** for use by our platform cooperative, currently in formation.

## About studio.coop

**studio.coop** is a platform cooperative being formed by fitness and wellness studio operators to collectively own and govern their studio management software. The cooperative will provide scheduling, payments, community, and website tools to member studios.

### Cooperative Nature

studio.coop meets the definition of a cooperative as recognized by the International Cooperative Alliance:

- **Owned by its users**: Studio operators who subscribe to the platform become co-op members with ownership stakes
- **Democratically governed**: One studio, one vote on all governance matters
- **Operates for member benefit**: Surplus is reinvested in the platform or returned to members as patronage dividends
- **Cannot be acquired**: The cooperative structure prevents external acquisition or private equity takeover

### Formation Status

The cooperative is currently in the **formation phase**:
- Market research and product development are underway
- Founding team has been assembled
- Founding studio members are being recruited (target: 5-10 studios in NZ/AU)
- Formal incorporation will follow founding member recruitment
- Jurisdictions under consideration: New Zealand (Cooperative Societies Act), United States (state cooperative statutes), or United Kingdom (Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act)

### Domain Usage

The domain studio.coop will be used for:
- The cooperative's primary website and marketing
- Studio member subdomains (e.g., empirestudio.studio.coop)
- Email communications (hello@studio.coop)
- The cooperative's platform services

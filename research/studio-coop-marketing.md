# studio.coop — Marketing & Customer Acquisition Strategy

## The Positioning

**"Own your platform. Own your community."**

studio.coop isn't just another Mindbody alternative — it's a platform cooperative where studios collectively own the software they depend on. Every dollar you pay builds equity, not someone else's exit.

---

## Customer Acquisition Channels

### 1. 🔥 Studio-to-Studio Referral (Primary Channel)

Studio owners talk. A lot. They're in the same neighborhoods, attend the same conferences, share the same frustrations. This is THE channel.

**How it works:**
- Every studio that joins gets referral codes
- Referred studios get first month free + the referrer gets a month credited
- But the real hook: *every studio you bring in increases YOUR ownership stake*
- "I brought 5 studios to the co-op" = social capital + literal equity

**Why it works:**
- Studio owners already recommend software to each other (see Reddit threads — every "what should I switch to?" post gets 20+ responses)
- Co-op alignment: growing the network benefits everyone
- Anti-Mindbody sentiment is a shared identity — "we left together"

### 2. 📱 Reddit & Online Communities (Guerrilla/Organic)

Active communities where studio owners ask for alternatives RIGHT NOW:
- r/pilates — multiple "Has anyone migrated away from Mindbody?" threads
- r/personaltraining — "What do you dislike about Mindbody?" threads
- r/yoga, r/crossfit, r/orangetheory
- Facebook Groups: "Studio Owner Support Group", "Pilates Business Owners", "Yoga Studio Owners"
- Smaller competitors mentioned: Momence ($60/mo), Time2book, Arketa

**Strategy:**
- Don't shill. Be genuinely helpful in threads
- Create a "Switching from Mindbody" guide (SEO gold)
- Studio owners who've switched write honest posts about their experience
- The co-op angle is genuinely novel — it'll generate organic discussion

### 3. 🏛️ The Co-op Story (PR & Content)

This is a STORY. Tech media, co-op media, fitness media all have an angle:
- **Tech**: "Platform co-op challenges PE-owned fitness SaaS"
- **Fitness**: "Studio owners build their own Mindbody alternative"
- **Co-op**: "studio.coop proves platform cooperativism works in SaaS"
- **Local**: "Local studios band together to own their tech"

Outlets:
- Shareable.coop, platform.coop network
- Fitness industry: Club Industry, IDEA Health & Fitness, Athletic Business
- Tech: TechCrunch (love the co-op angle), The Verge
- Podcasts: tons of fitness business podcasts hungry for content

### 4. 🎪 Conference & Event Presence

Where studio owners congregate:
- **IDEA World Fitness Convention** — biggest in the industry
- **Club Industry Conference**
- **Pilates Method Alliance (PMA) Conference**
- **Yoga Alliance events**
- **IHRSA (International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association)**
- Local/regional fitness business meetups

Strategy: Don't get a booth. Host a side dinner/meetup: "Studio Owners Co-op Dinner" — intimate, builds relationships, feels like a movement not a sales pitch.

### 5. 🌱 The "Free Migration" Wedge

The #1 barrier to switching is data migration pain. Every Reddit thread mentions it.

**Offer:**
- Free, white-glove migration from Mindbody/Vagaro/Glofox
- AI-assisted: import class schedules, member data, payment info
- "We'll have you running in 48 hours"
- No contract, cancel anytime (co-op, not corporate)

### 6. 💬 The "Leave Mindbody Together" Campaign

Studio owners know each other. In many cities, aerial/yoga/pilates studios are a tight community.

**Campaign idea:**
- Target a city. Find 5-10 studios that know each other.
- Pitch them collectively: "What if your whole city's studios switched together?"
- Group migration support, shared learning, local co-op chapter
- First city becomes the case study for the next

This is how co-ops have always grown — community by community.

### 7. 🤖 AI-Built Sites as Lead Gen

The AI site builder IS the marketing:
- "Get a free studio website in 5 minutes" — no commitment needed
- Studio owner enters their info, AI generates a beautiful site
- They see what studio.coop looks like with THEIR branding
- Even if they don't sign up immediately, they've experienced the product
- Follow up: "Your site is ready. Want to add booking and payments?"

### The Anti-Mindbody Messaging

Don't be bitter, but be clear:

| Mindbody | studio.coop |
|---|---|
| PE-owned (Vista Equity) | Studio-owned cooperative |
| From $110 AUD/mo | From $69 AUD/mo |
| Branded app = add-on | Branded app included |
| No community features | Social feeds, video sharing, group chat |
| Their marketplace, your content | Your domain, your brand, your community |
| Data lock-in | Open data, export anytime |
| "Let's talk" pricing | Transparent pricing |

## Pricing Strategy

### Sweet spot: $69-99/mo base
- Undercuts Mindbody significantly ($110+ and opaque)
- Competitive with WellnessLiving ($69-199)
- More than Vagaro ($45) but includes WAY more (social, branded app, AI site)
- Cheaper than Momence Custom ($199/mo)

### Tiers
- **Starter** ($69/mo) — Scheduling, payments, branded subdomain, community features, 1 staff
- **Growth** ($99/mo) — + AI site builder, custom domain, marketing tools, unlimited staff
- **Co-op** ($149/mo) — + branded app, advanced analytics, priority migration, accelerated equity

### Co-op Equity Model
- Monthly payments accumulate toward ownership stake
- After 12 months: founding member status
- After 24 months: voting rights on major decisions
- Governance: one studio, one vote

## Additional Competitors to Watch

Beyond the big 5, these came up in research:
- **Momence** — $60/mo pro, free tier, growing fast among yoga/pilates
- **Time2book** — praised for design/UX, newer
- **Arketa** — advanced but "clunky"
- **Trainerize** — more PT-focused
- None of them do co-op. None do social.

## Phase 1 Target Market

**Boutique fitness studios (yoga, pilates, aerial, dance, boxing)**
- Most frustrated with Mindbody
- Most social/community-oriented
- Tight-knit owner networks
- Price-sensitive but willing to pay for quality
- 50-500 members per studio

**Geography: Start in NZ/AU**
- Rabble's backyard, can do in-person outreach
- Empire as founding studio / case study
- Smaller market = easier to become known
- Then expand to US/UK/EU

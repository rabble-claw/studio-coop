# studio.coop — Cooperative Formation Documentation

## 1. Overview

**studio.coop** is a platform cooperative being formed to provide fitness and wellness studios with collectively-owned management software. The cooperative will be owned and governed by the studio operators who use the platform.

### Mission Statement
To build and operate a studio management platform (scheduling, payments, community) that is owned, governed, and operated for the benefit of its member studios — not external investors.

### Legal Structure
studio.coop will be incorporated as a **multi-stakeholder platform cooperative**, structured so that:
- Member studios hold ownership stakes proportional to their participation
- Governance follows a one-member, one-vote democratic model
- Surplus revenue is reinvested in the platform or distributed to members
- The cooperative cannot be acquired or sold without member approval

## 2. Why a Cooperative?

### The Problem with Incumbent Platforms
The fitness studio management software market is dominated by venture capital and private equity-backed companies:

- **Mindbody** — acquired by Vista Equity Partners (PE) in 2019 for $1.9B. Since acquisition, studio owners report rising prices, degraded UX, and misaligned incentives.
- **Vagaro** — VC-backed, optimizing for growth metrics over user needs.
- **Glofox** — acquired by ABC Fitness Solutions (PE-backed).
- **Mariana Tek** — acquired by Xplor Technologies.

In each case, the platform's incentives diverge from its users'. PE firms optimize for revenue extraction; studios need reliable, affordable tools.

### The Cooperative Alternative
A cooperative aligns incentives by making the users the owners:
- **No external shareholders** demanding returns at the expense of members
- **Democratic governance** ensures the roadmap serves actual studio needs
- **Price stability** — no pressure to raise prices to hit investor targets
- **Permanence** — cooperatives cannot be acquired against members' wishes
- **Shared value** — surplus is reinvested or returned to members

### Precedent
Platform cooperatives are a proven model in software:
- **Stocksy United** — photographer-owned stock photo platform
- **Up & Go** — worker-owned cleaning services platform
- **Resonate** — musician-owned music streaming cooperative
- **Open Food Network** — cooperative food distribution platform

## 3. Cooperative Structure

### Membership
- **Eligibility**: Any fitness, wellness, or movement studio operating commercially
- **Joining**: Studios become provisional members upon subscribing to the platform ($99 AUD/month)
- **Full membership**: After 12 months of continuous membership, studios become full cooperative members with voting rights
- **Founding members**: Studios joining during the formation period receive founding member status with additional governance privileges during the initial period

### Governance

#### Board of Directors
- Elected by member studios, one-member-one-vote
- Initial board appointed by founders during formation period
- Annual elections after the cooperative reaches 50 member studios
- Board seats reserved for geographic diversity (no single region holds majority)

#### Decision Making
- **Operational decisions**: Made by the management team / automated systems
- **Strategic decisions**: Board approval required
- **Constitutional changes** (pricing model, ownership structure, dissolution): Require 2/3 supermajority of all members

#### Committees
- **Product Committee**: Member studios advising on feature priorities
- **Finance Committee**: Oversight of cooperative finances
- **Membership Committee**: Reviewing applications, onboarding

### Financial Model

#### Revenue
- Monthly platform subscription: $99 AUD per studio location
- Payment processing: pass-through at cost (no markup)
- Optional premium services at cost-plus

#### Allocation of Surplus
Following International Cooperative Alliance principles:
1. **Operating reserve** (minimum 3 months expenses)
2. **Platform development** (reinvestment in features, infrastructure)
3. **Member education and community** (training, events, resources)
4. **Patronage dividends** (returned to members proportional to usage, when surplus permits)

#### Equity
- Members build equity through monthly payments
- Equity is non-transferable and non-speculative
- Upon leaving the cooperative, members may receive their equity back per the bylaws (subject to the cooperative's financial health)

## 6. Technology

### Platform Stack
- Modern web application with AI-assisted development
- Each studio gets a branded subdomain (e.g., empire.studio.coop) or custom domain
- Native iOS and Android apps, white-labeled per studio
- AI-powered website builder for studio marketing sites
- Open data: studios can export all their data at any time

### Key Differentiators
1. **Community features**: Social feeds, video sharing, group chats — replacing the 5 fragmented apps studios currently use alongside their booking software
2. **AI-built websites**: Studios get a beautiful, auto-updating website by describing their studio in natural language
3. **Cooperative ownership**: The platform improves because members direct it, not investors
4. **Local payment rails**: Support for PIX (Brazil), UPI (India), SEPA (EU), and other direct bank transfer systems alongside traditional card processing

### Open Source Commitment
The cooperative is committed to open-source principles where feasible. Core platform components will be released under open-source licenses, ensuring that:
- Members can audit the software they depend on
- The platform cannot be held hostage by any single developer or team
- The broader cooperative movement benefits from shared infrastructure

## 7. Alignment with Cooperative Principles

studio.coop adheres to the **International Cooperative Alliance's Seven Cooperative Principles**:

1. **Voluntary and Open Membership**: Any qualifying studio can join regardless of gender, social, racial, political, or religious affiliation
2. **Democratic Member Control**: One studio, one vote. Members actively participate in governance
3. **Member Economic Participation**: Members contribute equitably to cooperative capital. Surplus is allocated for development, reserves, and patronage
4. **Autonomy and Independence**: The cooperative maintains independence. No external investors or acquirers can control the platform
5. **Education, Training, and Information**: Members receive training on the platform and cooperative governance. The public is informed about the cooperative model
6. **Cooperation Among Cooperatives**: studio.coop will actively participate in the platform cooperativism movement and collaborate with other cooperatives
7. **Concern for Community**: studio.coop strengthens local fitness and wellness communities through its social features and community-first approach
